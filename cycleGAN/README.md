## [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)

### Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola & Alexei A. Efros

This is my [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of the CycleGAN algorithm, which enables unpaired image-to-image translation. There is an official PyTorch implementation together with paired [pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) available on [this link](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix). This brilliant implementation was a constant source of inspiration for both this and my pix2pix project.

Saved weights for the results below can be found on my [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qSebyz5fwMFonhR8-fkDtup8-IwHsOa0?usp=sharing).

#### Result

Since these models are quite big and given I only use free colab for computation, all models are still in training. Results will be posted once a model is finished.
